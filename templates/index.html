                    <p>The first app I built was a web app for my first company out of college, built on the Django framework. 
                        It allowed for a simple form entry for account managers to input data on their ad campaigns, which fed to a Tableau dashboard that tracked 
                        the amount the campaign spent v its budget. This dashboard was re-inserted as an iframe back into the app so in real time 
                        AMs could see how their campaigns were spending v. their allowance, with a friendly GUI.</p>

                    <p>I've since moved on to Python for automation of data flows, using Data Build Tools to optimize ETL processes.
                        At a recent position, I led the design of a new DBT architecture that allowed for reduction in data redundancy.
                        Instead of having multiple ETL jobs recreating certain temp tables over and over in each script, I created staging and core layers in DBT
                        that allowed for the creation of these tables only once, and fed the data down the pipeline to other DBT data models. This 
                        created consistency of data pulls and reduced demand as the logic was not necessary to recreate.</p>
